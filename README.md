# Bread Preorder System

The hofpfisterei is a traditional bread business based in Bavaria, Germany. Usually, customers need to call in order to make a bread preorder. The idea of this project is to offer an **online platform** where **customers can create their preorders without waiting** for someone to answer the phone in one of the selling points. The platform will be created using React and REST Framework
